# Database

At this subject, I was completed a course project.
Primary requirements:
  - Make a general textual description of the database and the tasks it solves;
  - The minimum number of tables is 10;
  - Scripts for creating a database structure (with primary keys, indexes, foreign keys);
  - Create an ER-Diagram for the database;
  - Scripts for filling the database with data;
  - Characteristic selections scripts (including groupings, JOINs, nested tables);
  - Performances (minimum 2);
  - Stored procedures / triggers;

The course project is implemented on my view of the structure of the Yandex.Drive car sharing database. 
A full description of the database is presented in the file YD_Discription.odt
